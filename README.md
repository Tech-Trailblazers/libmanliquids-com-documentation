## 🌍 What Are SDS & MSDS?

- 🧪 **SDS (Safety Data Sheet)**: A document that provides information on the properties of a chemical, including hazards, handling, storage, and emergency measures.
- 🧾 **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)**: The older version of SDS, still used in some regions, but generally replaced by the SDS format.
- 🛡️ **Why Important?** They help protect workers, students, researchers, and communities by ensuring safe handling of chemicals.
